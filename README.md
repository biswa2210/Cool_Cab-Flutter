**This flutter application is totally responsive.** When we change the orientation the app fits in that. I have used [FLUTTER](https://flutter.dev/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw38-DBhDpARIsADJ3kjliHdMH2hA97bBGqJtW5ORUUksCxpZ8cnrSWaH__HevGftAmP8AmvIaAhNlEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/) in front end and backend.
